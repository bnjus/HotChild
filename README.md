# HotChild Project
a Device that alerts parents if their child is in danger in a hot car

## Project Overview
This project uses a particle board photon 2 to monitor a BME280 temp sensor to indicate if temperature is too high for a child
to be safe in a car. It alerts the user via text message and email to look at their video camera to see if indeed their child is in the hot car. If there is a child in the car, there is a GPS locator installed to help direct someone to the car to rescue the child or children, and in addition there will be speakers installed in the device to help talk to the child to give them instructions to unbuckle themselves and unlock the doors.
